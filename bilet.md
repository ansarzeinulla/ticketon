# Software Requirements Specification

BiletFlow: Self-Service Event Ticketing Platform for Kazakhstan 

Version: 0.3 

Status: Initial Draft 

Project Type: Web and mobile event and ticket management platform 

## Executive Summary

BiletFlow is a Kazakhstan-focused self-service platform that allows individuals, student organizations, businesses, and community groups to create events and issue digital tickets. 

Creating an event and distributing free tickets is free. Organizers who want to sell paid tickets must activate paid sales for the event by paying a one-time activation fee and completing identity and payout verification. 

The platform provides event pages, ticket inventory management, online registration, secure payments, QR-code tickets, calendar export, attendee management, and a mobile ticketverification app for event administrators. 

## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the initial requirements for BiletFlow. It describes the platform’s users, business model, main features, constraints, and MVP scope. 

## 1.2 Scope

The platform will allow organizers to: 

• Create and publish public or private physical events held at a venue. 

• Create multiple ticket types. 

• Configure assigned-seating events and interactive seat maps. 

• Issue free tickets without paying a platform fee. 

• Activate paid ticket sales for individual events. 

• Set prices, quantities, and sale periods. 

• Track registrations and revenue. 

• Send digital tickets containing unique QR codes. 

• Allow attendees to download and print their tickets. 

• Assign event administrators who verify tickets and check attendees in through a mobile app. 

• Allow attendees to export event details to their preferred calendars. 

• Cancel orders and process refunds where permitted. 

Attendees will be able to discover events, register or purchase tickets, receive digital tickets, add event details to their calendars, and present their tickets for check-in. 

## 1.3 Definitions

• Organizer: A user who creates and manages an event. 

• Attendee: A person who registers for or purchases a ticket. 

• Event Admin: An organizer-authorized user who uses the mobile app to verify tickets and check in attendees. This role is separate from the Platform Admin. 

• Free Ticket: A ticket with no payment requirement. 

• Paid Ticket: A ticket that requires payment during checkout. 

• Paid Sales Activation: The process that enables an organizer to collect money for an event. 

• Support Case: A support request linked to a user, event, order, or ticket and represented through an asynchronous chat-like conversation. 

• Promo Code: An organizer-created code that applies a configured ticket discount and attributes the resulting order to a campaign. 

• Campaign QR Code: A promotional QR code that opens an event page through a trackable link and automatically applies its associated promo code. It is not an admission ticket. 

• Platform Admin: Internal staf responsible for moderation, disputes, and platform management. 

• Payment Processor: An external service that processes payments and organizer payouts. 

## 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective

BiletFlow will consist of: 

• A responsive web application for organizers and attendees. 

• A dedicated iOS and Android application for event administrators to verify tickets and manage check-in. 

• An administrative web portal. 

• Backend services for events, orders, payments, tickets, support cases, promotional campaigns, notifications, and reporting. 

• Integrations with a payment processor, email provider, and calendar-export services. 

## 2.2 Stakeholders

• Event organizers 

• Attendees 

• Event administrators and check-in staf 

• Platform administrators 

• Payment and payout providers 

• Development and QA teams 

• Project sponsors and business stakeholders 

## 2.3 User Classes

## Attendee

Can browse events, register, purchase tickets, download tickets, and review existing orders. 

## Organizer

Can create events, configure ticket types, activate paid sales, manage attendees, view sales, and assign check-in staf. 

## Event Admin

Can use the mobile app to select assigned events, scan and verify QR-code tickets, search for attendees, and record or reverse check-ins. 

## Platform Admin

Can moderate events, manage users, review payment activation requests, handle disputes, and view platform reports. 

## 3. Business and Monetization Model

## 3.1 Free Events

Organizers may: 

• Create and publish events without charge. 

• Create free ticket types. 

• Issue QR-code tickets. 

• Use attendee lists and check-in functionality. 

• Send basic confirmation messages. 

## 3.2 Paid Events

Paid ticket sales remain disabled until the organizer: 

1. Creates an event and at least one paid ticket type. 

2. Completes identity and payout verification. 

3. Pays the event’s Paid Sales Activation Fee. 

4. Connects or registers a valid payout account. 

5. Accepts the paid-event terms. 

Once activated, the organizer can collect ticket payments for that event. 

For the academic MVP, identity checks, activation-fee payment, ticket payment, and organizer payouts may be implemented with a provider sandbox or clearly labelled simulation. No real money movement is required for the term demonstration. 

## 3.3 Recommended Initial Pricing Model

• Free events: no platform fee. 

• Paid Sales Activation Fee: one-time fee per event, charged in KZT; amount to be determined. 

• Payment-processing charges: deducted from each transaction. 

• Optional per-ticket service fee: excluded from the initial MVP and considered for a later release. 

This model gives organizers the complete basic workflow at no cost and charges them only when they intend to generate revenue.

## 9. Suggested Technology Stack

The frontend and mobile technologies are recommended for consistency, while the team may choose the backend language that best matches its experience. The academic MVP shall use one primary backend implementation; creating the same services in multiple languages or introducing unnecessary microservices is outside the term scope. 

• Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB with Mongoose. PostgreSQL may be paired with Node.js, Python, Go, or Java; selecting Node.js does not require MongoDB. 

• Backend Option 1 - JavaScript/TypeScript: Node.js with Express or a comparable framework; this produces a MERN-style stack when combined with MongoDB and React 

• Backend Option 2 - Python: FastAPI or Django • Backend Option 3 - Go: Go with a lightweight HTTP framework or the standard HTTP library 

• Backend Option 4 - Java: Spring Boot 

• Web Application: React; Next.js may be used when server-side rendering or search visibility is needed 

• Seat Map UI: React with SVG or Canvas rendering, one predefined layout, and servervalidated seat holds 

• Mobile Ticket-Verification App: React Native, optionally with Expo 

• Frontend Language: TypeScript is recommended across the web application and React Native app; it may also be shared with the backend when Node.js is selected 

• Styling: Tailwind CSS 

• Payments: Provider sandbox or internal simulation using KZT; production provider integration is deferred 

• Email: Transactional email provider 

• File Storage: S3-compatible object storage 

• Printable Tickets: Server-generated PDF based on the canonical ticket record 

• Support Chat: REST API with periodic refresh or lightweight polling; real-time sockets are optional and not required 

• Campaign QR Codes: Server-generated QR images containing signed or opaque promotional links 

• Analytics: Database aggregation for exact sales/redemption data and optional GA4 ecommerce/campaign events for trafic attribution 

• Deployment: Docker containers 

• Design: Figma 

• Testing: Automated API, interface, payment, and QR-validation tests 

The backend language and database shall be selected during the initial architecture phase and documented with a short rationale covering team familiarity, development speed, data-model requirements, and deployment complexity. 

## 10. Assumptions and Dependencies

• The team can access a suitable payment sandbox or implement a clearly labelled payment simulation. 

• The initial release will operate in Kazakhstan and use KZT as its settlement currency. 

• Payment, privacy, refund, and organizer-verification rules will be reviewed for compliance with applicable Kazakhstan requirements before launch. 

• Organizers are responsible for event legality, descriptions, and refund policies. 

• Attendees have access to email or an online account for ticket delivery. 

• Event Admins have supported iOS or Android devices with working cameras. 

• Event venues provide internet access for real-time check-in; ofline check-in is outside the academic MVP. 

• AI-assisted tools may be used during development; this document does not prescribe a particular tool or AI-assisted workflow. 

• Final production fees, supported payment methods, payment provider, and payout timing remain future decisions. 

## 11. Initial Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when: 

• An organizer can publish a free event and distribute valid tickets. 

• An organizer can complete the simulated or sandboxed paid-sales activation and receive demonstration orders. 

• An attendee can complete checkout and receive a QR-code ticket. 

• An attendee can download and print a ticket that remains scannable at check-in. 

• An Event Admin can use the mobile app to validate tickets and prevent duplicate entry. 

• An attendee can open a contextual support case and exchange asynchronous messages with authorized organizer staf. 

• An attendee can scan a Campaign QR Code, receive a valid discount, and complete an order attributed to the campaign. 

• An admission scanner rejects Campaign QR Codes while continuing to accept valid ticket QR codes. 

• Organizers can view accurate ticket, attendance, payment, and refund records. 

• Organizers can view basic sales, capacity, campaign, and attendance analytics without adding fields to the attendee checkout. 

• Organizers can review past and cancelled events, inspect an authorized activity timeline, and duplicate a past event without copying historical transactions. 

• Administrators can suspend a suspicious event and stop further sales. 

Bonus features are evaluated separately and are not required to satisfy the base MVP success criteria. 

## 12. Key Decisions for the Next Draft

• Final project and product name 

• Final backend selection among Node.js, Python, Go, and Java, together with MongoDB or PostgreSQL 

• Activation fee amount and refundability 

• Payment sandbox or simulation method for the academic MVP 

• Whether attendees must create accounts 

• Whether processing fees are paid by organizers or attendees 

• Payout delay and reserve policy 

• Organizer verification requirements 

• Event cancellation and refund rules 

• Predefined seating layout used for the demonstration 

• Whether support cases allow file attachments in the academic MVP 

• Initial promo-code discount types, redemption limits, and campaign reporting fields 

• Default date ranges and chart formats for the basic organizer dashboard 

• Academic retention period for event history and audit entries 

## 13. Term Feasibility and Delivery Plan

## 13.1 Feasibility Target

The project is planned as a polished academic prototype developed by a team of five over 10–12 weeks. The team may use AI-assisted development tools. The term deliverable is not intended to be a production financial platform. 

The MVP is feasible only if the team maintains the scope boundaries in Section 8. Real payments, real payouts, production identity verification, arbitrary venue-map creation, ofline scanner synchronization, and application-store publication are not term requirements. 

## 13.2 Suggested Team Ownership

Each area shall have one primary owner, with peer review from at least one other team member: 

1. Architecture, integration, authentication, and deployment 

2. Backend event, ticket, order, and seat-reservation services 

3. Organizer and attendee web interfaces 

4. Admin interface, promotional campaigns, basic reporting, organizer history, calendar bonus, and printable tickets 

5. React Native verification app, support workflow, assigned-seating bonus, automated testing, and release coordination 

Ownership does not prevent collaboration. Shared API contracts and data models should be agreed before parallel implementation begins. 

## 13.3 Suggested 12-Week Schedule

• Weeks 1–2: select one backend stack, confirm scope, prepare wireframes, define API contracts and data model, and configure repositories and automated checks 

• Weeks 3–4: implement authentication, roles, organizer profiles, and event creation 

• Weeks 5–6: implement ticket types, inventory, sandbox checkout, orders, and QR generation 

• Week 7: implement printable PDF tickets, promo codes, and Campaign QR Codes; add calendar export only if the core flow is on schedule 

• Week 8: implement the React Native online verification app and asynchronous support workflow 

• Week 9: implement basic administration, organizer history, and the required analytics dashboard; add assigned seating or advanced GA4 analytics only if the core flow is stable 

• Week 10: integrate features, resolve cross-application defects, and complete core-flow tests 

• Weeks 11–12: stabilize, improve usability, prepare documentation, rehearse the demonstration, and retain contingency time 

For a 10-week term, Weeks 7–9 should overlap where team capacity permits, while Week 10 remains reserved for integration and stabilization. 

## 13.4 Scope and Quality Controls

• Core end-to-end flow takes priority: create event, distribute a campaign QR, apply a promo code, select or reserve a ticket, complete simulated checkout, issue the ticket, request support, and verify entry. 

• Feature development should stop after Week 9 unless a missing feature blocks the core demonstration. 

• Each feature is complete only when integrated, reviewed, tested, and documented. 

• Bonus features shall not be started at the expense of an incomplete required flow. 

• If the project falls behind, remove assigned seating, calendar export, advanced analytics, localization polish, and refund simulation before cutting the core ticketing flow.
